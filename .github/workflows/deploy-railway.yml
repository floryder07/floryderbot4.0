          # The exact CLI command can change across railway CLI versions.
          # Common pattern:
          # 1) Change to project dir or ensure project is linked in Railway.
          # 2) Run `railway up` to deploy; flags can be used to specify project/service/env.
          #
          # Example (may need adjustments depending on your Railway setup):
          railway up --projectId $RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID --serviceId $RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID --environment $RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT --yes

          # If your Railway project repository is linked in the Railway dashboard,
          # `railway up` without flags will typically deploy the linked project.
          #
          # If the CLI version or your process requires different arguments, replace the command above.
